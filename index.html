       <p>We both know an email list gives your business real value, so investing in the right candidate is crucial.</p>
       <p>You know that quote, <span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">"If you don't have an email list, you don't have a business."</span></p>
       <p>This is why, I don't just code emails.</p>
       <p>Don't believe me?</p> 
       <p>Look at these email templates I built just for you.</p>

        <h3>Pleasure to meet you</h3>
        <div class="rich-text-content">
        <p>Glad you were able to see my work, as an email developer, my goal is to create impactful email campaigns.</p>
        <p>My name is William Gregorio by the way, while a template might not capture everything, it's an introduction.</p>
        <p>You'll notice my writing reflects how I speak, it should connect with you more, so this means I do leverage copywriting while email developing, since coding is just one part of email development.</p>
        <p>But my expertise goes more than just an email template.</p>
        <p>I can create campaign structures that include real cron jobs and automation to optimize your email marketing strategy.</p>
        <p>My skills extend to WordPress and Shopify too, this means I can easily integrate email campaigns into custom web strategies.</p>
        <p>Beyond this, you should know that I love quality and craftmanship.</p>
        <p>I bring that same energy to work, so yes I will rather buy a Luigi Borreli Napoli shirt with mother-of-pearl buttons or invest into goodyear-welted shoes like Gaziano & Girling. I also enjoy watches, like Grand Seiko.</p>
        <p>So in summary, I find joy in the little things, because they hold significant value, this mindset translates into my professional work and the returns are amazing.</p>
